# Purpose: 
#     This report shows the clock trees for clocks. It is generated if rule
#     Clock_info02 has been enabled and clock constraints have been defined 
#     or parameter use_inferred_clocks enabled.
#     This report is sensitive to any case analysis settings that have been set.
# 
# Format: 
#     Clock tree is shown in a tree-like format.(The nodes are indented according to
#     their position in hierarchy,"`--" is  used to indicate whether a net/cell is
#     the last child at a particular level,"|--" is used for rest of the nodes. The
#     level is also printed in braces before every net/cell).
#     The (+)/(-) suffix to a leaf-level cell output net name indicates the clock
#     polarity reaching the flip-flop.
#     When (x) suffix is present, it indicates that clock polarity could not be
#     uniquely determined.
# 
#     A leaf on the tree can be one of:
#     a. A register inferred from the RTL - the hierarchical name of the registered
#                   net is shown along with the polarity of the clock at that point
# 
#     b. A black box - the hierarchical name of the black box instance is annotated
#                   with its master name, the name of the pin connected to the clock,
#                   the polarity of the clock and (Black-Box) to indicate that this
#                   is a black box
# 
#     c. A latch inferred from the RTL - the hierarchical name of the latched net is
#                   shown along with the polarity of the clock and (Latch) to indicate
#                   that this is latched net. For a latch to be a leaf, the enable
#                   pin of the latch should be connected to the clock.
# 
#     d. A sequential leaf cell - the hierarchical name of the sequential instance,
#                   which is neither known to be a flop nor a latch, is annotated
#                   with its master name, the name of the pin connected to the clock,
#                   the polarity of the clock and (Sequential Logic Cell) to indicate
#                   that this is a sequential leaf cell
# 
#     The intermediate nodes of a tree can be one of:
#     a. A net - the hierarchical name of the net found while walking along a path
#                from the root of the tree to a leaf is shown
#     b. A register inferred from the RTL - this is possible when the register is a
#                divide-by-two counter used to divide the clock frequency by two. The
#                hierarchical name of the registered net is shown along with the
#                polarity of the clock at that point.
# 
#     If the same intermediate node is observed more than once on different paths
#     from root to leaves, then the sub-tree beyond this node is shown only after its
#     first occurence in the tree. For the other occurences, a reference to the 
#     sub-tree is shown. This rule is recursively followed for the sub-trees also.

This section is empty because of one or more of the following reasons:
-  Either 'clock' constraint has not been specified in the constraint
   file or parameter 'use_inferred_clocks' has not been set to 'yes'.
-  Rule Clock_info02 has not been run.
