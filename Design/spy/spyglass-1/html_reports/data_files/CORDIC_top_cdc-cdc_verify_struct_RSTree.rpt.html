# Purpose: 
#     This report shows the reset trees for resets. It is generated if you have
#     enabled rule Reset_info02 and defined reset constraints or enabled parameter
#     use_inferred_resets.
#     This report is sensitive to any case analysis settings that have been set.
# 
# Format: 
#     The trees are shown in a tree-like format.(The nodes are indented according to
#     their position in hierarchy,"`--" is  used to indicate whether a net/cell is
#     the last child at a particular level,"|--" is used for rest of the nodes. The 
#     level is also printed in braces before every net/cell).
#     The (+)/(-) suffix to a leaf-level cell output net name indicates the reset
#     polarity reaching the flip-flop.
#     When (x) suffix is present, it indicates that reset polarity could not be
#     uniquely determined.
# 
#     A leaf on the tree can be one of:
#     a. A register inferred from the RTL - the hierarchical name of the registered
#                net is shown along with the polarity of the reset at that point
#     b. A black box - the hierarchical name of the black box instance is annotated
#                with its master name, the name of the pin connected to the reset, 
#                the polarity of the reset and (Black-Box) to indicate that
#                this is a black box
#     c. A latch inferred from the RTL - the hierarchical name of the latched net is
#                shown along with the polarity of the reset and (Latch) to indicate 
#                that this is latched net. For a latch to be a leaf, the data pin
#                of the latch should be connected to the reset.
#     d. A sequential leaf cell - the hierarchical name of the sequential instance, 
#                which is neither known to be a flop nor a latch, is annotated with 
#                its master name, the name of the pin connected to the reset, the polarity
#                of the reset and (Sequential Logic Cell) to indicate that this is a 
#                sequential leaf cell
# 
#     The intermediate nodes of a tree are the hierarchical name of the net found while 
#     walking along a path from the root of the tree to a leaf
#     If the same intermediate node is observed more than once on different paths
#     from root to leaves, then the sub-tree beyond this node is shown only after its
#     first occurence in the tree. For the other occurences, a reference to the sub-tree
#     is shown. This rule is recursively followed for the sub-trees also.

This section is empty because of one or more of the following reasons:
-  Either 'reset' constraint has not been specified in the constraint
   file or parameter 'use_inferred_resets' has not been set to 'yes'.
-  Rule Reset_info02 has not been run.
